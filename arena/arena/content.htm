    <h2>Welcome to the Arena Chronicles</h2>
    <article>
        <p>Step into the boots or naked feet of  Faustile Moiré; schollar bound by fate, walking the perilous paths all across Tamriel. Here, you'll
            follow the journey of one who wakes from the depths of the Imperial Sewers to face a chaotic and dangerous
            world beyond himself.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <article>
        <p>This recollection aims to scope onto my own fantasies and self-being onto The Elder Scrolls in general and TES: Arena in particular. A new modus vivendi towards fantasy, gaming, and roleplaying. Out of my twenty-two years of living and precarious —yet still— approaches to Tabletop Roleplaying and Videogame Roleplaying, innumerous hours spent on a variety of MMOs, offline campaigns, open world and more straightforward formats of game, even solo-delving onto the depths Dark Fort as Kargunt, I have never truly experienced that flesh, muscle, tissue & meat & bone of what it truly takes to be into those worlds; of the walking, truly exploring the vastness of meadow, desert, swamp and mountain, to depths of hell itself. And maybe it's mental exhaustion, a lack of true imagination, or just plain imaginative tiredness. I've ended up finding this out of lack inside what Elder Scrolls: Arena —and pretty much all of its titles, though I am commencing this journey from the beginning— could fulfill and take a step forward into this theatrical play of mine of fantasy and divertissement. Taking not only the means of my character in-game to play as him and kill and roam, but to take it further and capture his voice in a real-time written log diary of his own making.</p>
