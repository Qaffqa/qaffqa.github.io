        <h3>24th Heartfire. Turdas</h3>
        <p>7:21 am</p>
        <p>I ride until I arrived at the gates of lainlyn. I did not go inside the settlement.</p>

        <p>7:51 am</p>
        <p>
            I arrived at Black Dungeon Inn in the outskirts of Lainlyn. Hopefully I could get some information about Fang's
            Lair whereabouts here, and eat something warm, too.
        </p>
        <p>8:13 am</p>
        <p>Got a beer for myself. Drank alone. Got no news. I may be not too gracefull, streetwise...</p>

            Stumbbled upon Sub, he calls himself. Strange dunmer name. An intepreter, working on a translation of Dark
            Elvish poetry. The witty dunmer told me that there has been a strange talk about Fang Lair being near Rihad. Finally
            some direct clues about this hole's whereabouts. If I set foot inmediatly I shall arrive close to 11th of
            Frostfall. 900 km on horseback are no easy task, but I'll endure.
