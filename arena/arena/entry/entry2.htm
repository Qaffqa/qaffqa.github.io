        <h3>16th of Heartfire, Middas</h3>

            I arrived at Sentinel, the guardian of Starfall Bay. I should keep lurking this trecherous thing... though I
            think I should rest. These 12 days on horseback were painful. 600 km on my shoulders.
        </p>
        <p>3:34 am</p>
        <p>
            Stumbble upon a whore in the streets of Sentinel. Can't even remmember her name. Wreteched lowlifes... Minutes
            later another man, a beggar, told me Fang Lair is somewhere located in Hammerfell's wilderness. I should locate
            an in as soon as possible, arm myself and venture forth into the wild.
            Weirdly enough, I did not ask him directly about the place... he jsut spew.

            Finnally found an inn. The Dancing Port. I shal make night here, just one night. Look for a supplies store
            in
            the morning, and then head towards finfing this Fang Lair...
        </p>
        <p>
            The innkeeper said some stupid thing... "his" prophet said Summerset Isle is doomed to sink beneath sea.
            Without
            further explanation... This Aedra worshipers tend to amaze most of the times. Wonderful mysteries!
