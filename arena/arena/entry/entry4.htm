        <h3>12th of Frostfall, Loredas</h3>
        <p>1:50 am</p>
        <p>
            I arrived in The City-State of Rihad, Hammerfell. Rihad, souther most port of the province. I shall ask
            around a
            little more...
        </p>

        <p>1:53 am</p>
        <p>
            A priest was laying on the streets this late at night, he told me nothing about fang's lair, a myth he says.
            As
            many believe... He, regardless, point me at a close by inn, the Unfortunate Treasure. I shall rest 'til
            morning.
        </p>

        <p>8:00 am</p>
        <p>
            I walked until I saw a temple of some sort, not even bothered to look what it was, a redguardd suggested it
            to me. Upon arrival to its gates, another
            redguard, a woman this time, called Rhehte-si, told me about fang lair that someone uncovered something in a
            keep outside the city, showing the location of fang lair. She told me to check at the Palace to see what
            they
            say, but I shall be carefull as she warned me a band of knights was seen attacking any who left the city...
        </p>

        <p>8:35 am</p>
        <p>
            I walled into the Queen's audience chamber, such an array of many fine trappings and lavish forniture decorate
            these walls, the redguard sure have some refine taste. Ahead of me awaits Blubamka, Queen of Rihad. I overheard,
            Rihad is currently at wat with neighbor Taneth.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Queen agreed to tell me about Fang Lair in exchange of a favour. She told me a band of goblins led by
            Golthog the Dark attacked this stronghold, Stonekeep, carrying away much treasure, including a parchment wich
            held withing clues to decipher part of The Elder Scrolls which spoke of Fang Lair's location. She warned me,
            like they did previously, about this band of merecenaries outside of town. She sayd my arrival could be perhaps
            fortituous. She promised me to inscribe Fang Lair's location into my map if I recover the partchment from
            Stonekeep.
        </p>
        <p>I obviously agreed. It a perfect enough reward.</p>
        <p>She warnmed me again, as this Golthog the Dark was a necromancer in servitude of the Underking.</p>
        <p>She weaved me to farewell...</p>

        <p>9:04 am</p>
        <p>Head to the Mages Guild and bought some potions and a light spell. Heading to the city gates right now.</p>
