        <h3>3rd of Heartfire, Turdas. 3E 289</h3>
        <p>
            5:30 am
        </p>
        <p>
            I woke up in the Imperial Sewers, cold sweat clinging to me like a curse. A vision roused me—her name
            was
            Ria Silmane, a sorceress, or so she claimed. She was once the apprentice of Jagar Tharn, now slain in
            body
            but still tethered to this world by some unholy resolve. She told me I am her last hope. The Emperor,
            she
            said, is imprisoned in a plane of Oblivion, while Tharn wears his face like a mask and rules in his
            stead.
        </p>
        <p>
            It took me two days to claw my way out of those stinking tunnels—goblins in the shadows, giant rats
            gnawing
            at everything that lives or stinks of life. Who tends these places? No one. I scavenged what I could,
            dodged
            death more than once, and walked out with a few trinkets worth selling.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I sit in Shornhelm, a frigid city in High Rock. Strange as it sounds, I miss the sewer’s
            staleness—the
            stillness there. Here, the cold gnaws at my joints. I’ve rented a single room at the King’s Bird, an inn
            just crooked enough to remind me of home. Thirty septims bought me three nights. May they be enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ah—and I almost forgot the greater madness. Silmane spoke of my “Imperial Duty.” The Staff of Chaos. An
            unbreakable artifact forged by the Land itself, now shattered and scattered across Tamriel. Each
            fragment
            sealed, hidden. One lies in a place called Fang Lair, somewhere in the Dragon’s Teeth Mountains—at
            least,
            that’s what the ghost-witch whispered before fading from my vision. I’ll need to ask around. Maybe High
            Rock
            remembers.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the meantime, the innkeeper here, Hargabyth the Warrior (I don’t see it), gave me a simple
            errand—deliver
            a gold bar to the Elite Equipment Store for 32 gold. He could’ve paid me in ale and rent, but no, I
            suppose
            coin is coin. And I need it.

        <p>9:30 am</p>
        <p>
            I slept in the wilderness. Got distracted—and apparently today is Tales and Tallows. The city was a maze of
            festivity and I couldn’t find my way back to the King’s Bird in time. Ended up outside the city walls. Cold
            air blows—a chilling presence. I should check my map now that the sun’s above me.
            Met a girl near Shornhelm’s gates. A young and vibrant huntress named Carolyne Ashly. She told me of a
            physician deep in Valenwood’s wilds who can cure lycanthropy.5:30.. not that I need it—yet. I asked her
            about my more immediate concern: the whereabouts of the Elite Equipment Store. She said it lies southwest. I
            should head that way soon.
        </p>

        <p>10:36 am</p>
        <p>Entered the Mage’s Guild in Shornhelm. I should join—it might be worth it to learn a few tricks to keep up my
            sleeve. Bought the Invisibility spell, then headed out.</p>

        <p>11:09 am</p>
        <p>Finally made it to the Elite Equipment Store, thanks to Agrard Hearthhouse, a historian who kindly marked its
            location on my map. A well-mannered fellow. He said he’s been hired to write the chronicles of King Rodore’s
            family. Whoever this king is, he must have coin to throw around if he’s employing a full-time chronicler.
        </p>

        <p>It seems as if I would arrive late to my destiny. The blacksmith in EES wasn't awaiting my delivery.
            Nonetheless, I sold most of the valuables that are of no use to me, and bought some leather equipment and a
            saber. It suits me like a new skin.</p>

        <p>3:15 pm</p>
        <p>I kept asking around Shornhelm and its citiznes until one of them, a man in his middle-age, told me about
            some rummors concerning Fangs's Lair... I set foot to Sentinel right away.</p>
