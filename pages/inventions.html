                <p>Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, sincerely, to those who have one. As for me, even in communion
                    with the Holy Spirit, I do not cease to work the philosophical machinery, not even during holy
                    celebrations, because my epithalamus doesn’t allow it either. Be that as it may, the following seems
                    to me a subject more than fair, necessary, and above all, utterly necessary for the aberrant times
                    we live in.</p>
                <p>As with everything, thought arises, more often than not, from conversation—whether it be real and
                    true conversation, one-on-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many, disseminated through channels more or
                    less relevant, like voice through the air, a message to a private group, or even the rare ink on
                    paper via a messaging service.</p>
                <p>And so it arises and emanates from the most secluded surfaces of open conversation on the web, the
                    following statement by some user who is neither relevant nor holds greater importance beyond knowing
                    that he is an independent game developer who publishes “long and informative threads about Art and
                    Animation.” Ambition is necessary to achieve great things.</p>

                        withintentionality. If you understand this, then graphics from any era will seem beautiful to

            <section>
                <p>Let’s break this down step by step because it could become a bit uphill otherwise.</p>
                <p>The notion of "graphics" in the video game ecosystem—specifically from the perspective of the video
                    game consumer, not the developer (although here, given the brevity of the comment and considering
                    that it comes from a dev, it still seems like he’s speaking as a consumer, even if it likely wasn’t
                    his ɪɴᴛᴇɴᴛɪᴏɴᴀʟɪᴛʏ)—is understood through a sort of dichotomy that emerged at some irrelevant point
                    in time when video games began to experience certain technical power and could exploit their
                    technological capabilities. This dichotomy divides graphics into two categories: Graphics as
                    technical power and capability, aimed at realism and performance; and a second aspect, understood as
                    the creative process and artistic direction—the intentionality of “graphics.” Needless to say, the
                    former has been overshadowing the latter in the realm of AAA games, but who the hell seriously cares
                    about games from Luciferian corporations? — Let’s continue.</p>
                <p>Through this lens of intentionality, the argument is framed, albeit romantically—and not in its
                    19th-century sense—that in video games, artistic intentionality prevails over the technical
                    capabilities of the hardware on which the game is developed.</p>
                <p>At first glance, the comment makes sense. But to me, it seems crude—perhaps due to its innate nature
                    on the web, bordering on irony most of the time—and lacking in value. The notion of graphics is
                    already vague in itself, even within its duality of art versus polygons.</p>
                <p>But that’s not the point; rather, it’s about intentionality. Dismissing the weight, role, or
                    importance of hardware in older video games is, at best, a naïve move. In our time, that comment
                    makes sense because anything—absolutely anything—can be done, but if the goal is to make a comment
                    with some historical perspective, to “appreciate graphics from any era,” it is a mistake not to
                    consider the scope of later technologies.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>This glorification of intentionality in art (whether in video games or not)—even assuming it is
                    art—the artistic intention is already premeditated by the resources and space that the artist
                    inhabits, not only in terms of conceptual execution but also regarding the material causes behind
                    its formal result.</p>
                <p>Artistic intentionality within video games is as determined by hardware as the finish of a plastic
                    artwork is determined by the quality of the materials used. And yet there exists arte povera and art
                    brut.</p>
                <p>Now let’s address this “artistic intentionality,” the magnificent work of game art directors during
                    that glorious era for the medium—the ’90s and 2000s—where they alone, without anyone’s help, managed
                    to craft networks of sensations and textures, to configure entire panoramas rich in meaning and
                    beauty…</p>
                <p>Or so I’d like to believe. The truth is that the low-poly aesthetic we now celebrate (with fervor
                    bordering on fetishism) wasn’t so much a conscious act of genius as a result conditioned by the
                    hardware limitations of the time. Counted polygons, blurry textures, stiff animations, and even the
                    infamous “tank controls” (a concept I’ve discussed here before) were not “artistic decisions” but
                    practical solutions to technical problems. In this sense, “artistic intentionality” was deeply
                    intertwined with the hardware’s possibilities, the graphical engines of the era, and market demands:
                    to produce attractive games that operated within an acceptable performance margin for available
                    consoles and PCs.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>Today, however, this low-poly aesthetic has become a cultural symbol. Reclaimed by independent
                    developers and celebrated in indie circles, it now presents itself as a deliberate aesthetic
                    statement.</p>
                <p>The low-poly or PSX aesthetic, in its current form, is not just a nostalgic revival of a bygone era
                    but a cultural product responding to specific dynamics of the contemporary market. In an environment
                    saturated with hyper-realistic graphics and overly detailed worlds in AAA games, indie developers
                    opt for low-poly as an accessible, economical, and visually distinctive alternative. What was once
                    perceived as a limitation is now appropriated and redefined as an aesthetic loaded with intention.
                </p>
                <p>Here lies the paradox: while low-poly seems to oppose market logic, it actually fits perfectly within
                    it. It functions as a marker of authenticity and creativity in a market saturated with realistic
                    simulations, while simultaneously capitalizing on the nostalgic appeal for those who grew up with
                    first-generation PlayStation or Nintendo 64 games (or didn’t even know them—there’s a worthy
                    analysis of younger generations than a PS3, who fornicate with these categories). This aesthetic
                    cannot be separated from the flows of Capital, which quickly absorb any attempt at symbolic
                    resistance, transforming it into just another commodity.</p>
                <p>The question, then, is: To what extent is this true “artistic intentionality” and not merely a
                    simulacrum of the necessity-driven intentionality that arose back then? In many cases, indie games
                    adopting this style don’t do so as an act of rebellion but as a strategy to position themselves
                    within a market niche. Artistic intentionality goes out the window here since what seemed like a
                    conscious aesthetic decision is mediated by trends, expectations, and economic dynamics.</p>
                <p>This fetishization deserves scrutiny because it often simplifies and pornifies an era of video games.
                    Instead of acknowledging the technical and economic compromises that defined this aesthetic, it is
                    attributed a purity it never had. Thus, the material conditions that gave rise to these games are
                    erased, and an idealization emerges that ignores their insertion in the capitalist market dynamics
                    of their time.</p>
                    <p>Celebrating low-poly as a pure aesthetic, free from the “corruptions” of hyperrealism, risks falling into an uncritical form of nostalgia that not only ignores historical context but reinforces the same market logic it aimed to question.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>To wrap up, a bit of paraphraseology…</p>
                <p>Ignoring the flows of Capital in the analysis of video games—or any cultural production—reduces any attempt at interpretation to a superficial caricature. Video games, deeply embedded in the fabric of the global economy, cannot be disentangled from the forces that organize desire, aesthetic trends, and the technical possibilities of each historical moment. Their production occurs within a field of tensions where consumer demands, material limitations, and the socius—understood as the network of relationships that structure collective subjectivity—converge. In this sense, video games operate not just as entertainment media but as devices that intensify the socius. According to Deleuze and Guattari, the socius is that abstract machinery that territorializes and organizes desires, channeling the flows of Capital into specific cultural and economic forms. The video game, as a capture machine, absorbs and reconfigures aesthetic sensibilities, directing them toward consumable patterns. Here, contemporary low-poly aesthetics exemplify this dynamic.</p>
                <p>This, originally conceived as a technical solution to hardware limitations, it has been redefined today as a visual language evoking the retro. This transformation, however, is neither neutral nor spontaneous. Within the framework of the control society—where attention and desire are fundamental resources—low-poly resurges as a cultural artifact that captures and reconfigures subjectivities around a collective fiction: nostalgia for an idealized past. This nostalgia, carefully manufactured, is not merely an affective memory. It is a flow of desire capitalized upon, an aesthetic niche the market exploits to revitalize products and expand its reach. Developers not only participate in this logic but often reinforce it by reusing visual elements from the console era of the PS1 or PS2 under the pretext of artistic intentionality. Yet this intentionality cannot be disentangled from the material conditions that make it possible, nor from the market that sustains it.</p>
                <p>In its current form, low poly presents itself as an aesthetic that promises authenticity and resistance against the hyperrealism dominating AAA video games. But this promise is, in itself, an illusion. Far from being an alternative to the market, it is a byproduct of it—an aesthetic flow adapted to the demands of Capital. The authenticity that low poly seeks to embody is nothing more than a mask concealing its integration into consumer dynamics, where even the “underground” and the “alternative” are territorialized by the market. Much like arte povera or art brut, which challenged traditional notions of materials and forms, low poly might appear as a subversive gesture. However, while those movements operated in resistance to the market, avoiding its money-laundering mechanisms, contemporary low poly does not escape its logic. It functions as a device that intensifies the socius, capturing sensibilities and desires around an aesthetic defined not by independence but by its ability to generate consumption.</p>
                <p>To discuss video games without acknowledging the economic and social machinery that shapes them is an empty exercise. The low poly aesthetic, far from being a mere vestige of past eras, operates as a contemporary tool of Capital, capable of capturing subjectivities and redirecting them into new consumption cycles. In this sense, video games are not merely cultural products but machines of capture—devices for the intensification of the socius that reflect and reinforce the dynamics of the society of control. Any analysis that overlooks this dimension is doomed to reproduce, even unintentionally, the same logics it seeks to critique. In a medium like video games, deeply inscribed in the global economy, art and the market are inseparable, and nostalgia, like so many other emotions, becomes just another commodity.</p>
