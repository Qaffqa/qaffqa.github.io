                <h3>3rd of Heartfire, Turdas. 3E 289</h3>
                <p>
                    I woke up in the Imperial Sewers, cold sweat clinging to me like a curse. A vision roused me—her name
                    was
                    Ria Silmane, a sorceress, or so she claimed. She was once the apprentice of Jagar Tharn, now slain in
                    body
                    but still tethered to this world by some unholy resolve. She told me I am her last hope. The Emperor,
                    she
                    said, is imprisoned in a plane of Oblivion, while Tharn wears his face like a mask and rules in his
                    stead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It took me two days to claw my way out of those stinking tunnels—goblins in the shadows, giant rats
                    gnawing
                    at everything that lives or stinks of life. Who tends these places? No one. I scavenged what I could,
                    dodged
                    death more than once, and walked out with a few trinkets worth selling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I sit in Shornhelm, a frigid city in High Rock. Strange as it sounds, I miss the sewer’s
                    staleness—the
                    stillness there. Here, the cold gnaws at my joints. I’ve rented a single room at the King’s Bird, an inn
                    just crooked enough to remind me of home. Thirty septims bought me three nights. May they be enough.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ah—and I almost forgot the greater madness. Silmane spoke of my “Imperial Duty.” The Staff of Chaos. An
                    unbreakable artifact forged by the Land itself, now shattered and scattered across Tamriel. Each
                    fragment
                    sealed, hidden. One lies in a place called Fang Lair, somewhere in the Dragon’s Teeth Mountains—at
                    least,
                    that’s what the ghost-witch whispered before fading from my vision. I’ll need to ask around. Maybe High
                    Rock
                    remembers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the meantime, the innkeeper here, Hargabyth the Warrior (I don’t see it), gave me a simple
                    errand—deliver
                    a gold bar to the Elite Equipment Store for 32 gold. He could’ve paid me in ale and rent, but no, I
                    suppose
                    coin is coin. And I need it.
